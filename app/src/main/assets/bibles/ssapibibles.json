It arose out of the Hampton Court Conference, held by James I in 1604, with the object of arriving at a settlement between the Puritan and Anglican elements in the Church; but it was not one of the prime or original subjects of the conference. In the corse of discussion, Dr. Reynolds, president of Corpus Christi College, Oxford, the leader of the moderate Puritan party, referred to the imperfections and disagreements of the existing translations; and the suggestion of a new version, to be prepared by the best scholars in the country, was warmly taken up by the king. The conference, as a whole, was a failure; but James did not allow the idea of the revision to drop. He took an active part in the preparation of instructions for the work, and to him appears to be due the credit of two features which went far to secure its success. He suggested that the translation should be committed in the first instance to the universities (subject to subsequent review by the bishops and the Privy Council, which practically came to nothing), and thereby secured the services of the best scholars in the country, working in cooperation; and (on the suggestion of the bishop of London) he laid down that no marginal notes should be added, which preserved the new version from being the organ of any one party in the Church.<br><br> \r\nUltimately it was arranged that six companies of translators should be formed, two at Westminster, two at Oxford, and two at Cambridge. The companies varied in strength from 7 to 10 members, the total (though there is some little doubt with regard to a few names) being 47. The Westminster companies undertook Genesis to 2 Kings and the Epistles, the Oxford companies the Prophets and the Gospels, Acts, and Apocalypse, and the Cambridge companies 1 Chronicles to Ecclesiastes and the Apocrypha. A series of rules was drawn up for their guidance. The Bishop's Bible was to be taken as the basis. The old ecclesiastical terms were to be kept. No marginal notes were to be affixed, except for the explanation of Hebrew or Greek words. Marginal references, on the contrary, were to be supplied. As each company finished a book, it was to send it to the other companies for their consideration. Suggestions were to be invited from the clergy generally, and opinions requested on passages of special difficulty from any learned man in the land. \"These translations to be used when they agree better with the text than the Bishops' Bible, namely, Tyndale's, Matthew's, Coverdale's, Whitchurch's (i.e. the Great Bible), Geneva.\" The translators claim further to have consulted all the available versions and commentaries in other languages, and to have repeatedly revised their own work, without grudging the time which it required. The time occupied by the whole work is stated by themselves as two years and three-quarters. The several companies appear to have begun their labors about the end of 1607, and to have taken two years in completing their several shares. A final revision, occupying nine months, was then made by a smaller body, consisting of two representatives from each company, after which it was seen through the press by Dr. Miles Smith and Bishop Bilson; and in 1611 the new version, printed by R. Barker, the king's printer, was given to the world in a large folio volume (the largest of all the series of English Bibles) of black letter type. The details of its issue are obscure. There were at least two issues in 1611, set up independently, known respectively as the \"He\" and \"She\" Bibles, from their divergence in the translation of the last words of Ruth 3:15; and bibliographers have differed as to their priority, though the general opinion is in favor of the former. 1 Some copies have a wood-block, others an engraved title-page, with different designs. The title-page was followed by the dedication to King James, which still stands in our ordinary copies of the Authorized Version, and this by the translators' preface (believed to have been written by Dr. Miles Smith), which is habitually omitted. (It is printed in the present King's Printers' Variorum Bible, and is interesting and valuable both as an example of the learning of the age and for its description of the translators' labors.) For the rest, the contents and arrangement of the Authorized Version are too well known to every reader to need description.<br><br> \r\nNor is it necessary to dwell at length on the characteristics of the translation. Not only was it superior to all its predecessors, but its excellence was so marked that no further revision was attempted for over 250 years. Its success must be attributed to the fact which differentiated it from its predecessors, namely, that it was not the work of a single scholar (like Tyndale's, Coverdale's, and Matthew's Bibles), or of a small group (like the Geneva and Douai Bibles), or of a large number of men working independently with little supervision (like the Bishops' Bible), but was produced by the collaboration of a carefully selected band of scholars, working with ample time and with full and repeated revision. Nevertheless, it was not a new translation. It owed much to its predecessors. The translators themselves say, in their preface: \"We never thought from the beginning that we should need to make a new translation, nor yet to make of a bad one a good one, ... but to make a good one better, or out of many good ones one principal good one, not justly to be excepted against; that hath been our endeavor, that our mark.\" The description is very just. The foundations of the Authorized Version were laid by Tyndale, and a great part of his work continued through every revision. Each succeeding version added something to the original stock, Coverdale (in his own and the Great Bible) and the Genevan scholars contributing the largest share; and the crown was set upon the whole by the skilled labor of the Jacobean divines, making free use of the materials accumulated by others, and happily inspired by the gift of style which was the noblest literary achievement of the age in which they lived. A sense of the solemnity of their subject saved them from the extravagances and conceits which sometimes mar that style; and, as a result, they produced a work which, from the merely literary point of view, is the finest example of Jacobean prose, and has influenced incalculably the whole subsequent course of English literature. On the character and spiritual history of the nation it has left an even deeper mark, to which many writers have borne eloquent testimony; and if England has been, and is, a Bible-reading and Bible-loving country, it is in no small measure due to her possession of a version so nobly executed as the Authorized Version.<br><br> \r\nThe history of the Authorized Version after 1611 can be briefly sketched. In spite of the name by which it is commonly known, and in spite of the statement on both title-pages of 1611 that it was \"appointed to be read in churches,\" there is no evidence that it was ever officially authorized either by the Crown or by Convocation. Its authorization seems to have been tacit and gradual. The Bishops' Bible, hitherto the official version, ceased to be reprinted, and the Authorized Version no doubt gradually replaced it in churches as occasion arose. In domestic use its fortunes were for a time more doubtful, and for two generations it existed concurrently with the Geneva Bible; but before the century was out its predominance was assured. The first quarto and octavo editions were issued in 1612; and thenceforth editions were so numerous that it is useless to refer to any except a few of them. The early editions were not very correctly printed. In 1638 an attempt to secure a correct text was made by a small group of Cambridge scholars. In 1633 the first edition printed in Scotland was published. In 1701 Bishop Lloyd superintended the printing of an edition at Oxford, in which Archbishop Ussher's dates for Scripture chronology were printed in the margin, where they henceforth remained. In 1717 a fine edition, printed by Baskett at Oxford, earned bibliographical notoriety as \"The Vinegar Bible\" from a misprint in the headline over Luke 20. 2 In 1762 a carefully revised edition was published at Cambridge under the editorship of Dr. T. Paris, and a similar edition, superintended by Dr. B. Blayney, appeared at Oxford in 1769. These two editions, in which the text was carefully revised, the spelling modernized, the punctuation corrected, and considerable alteration made in the marginal notes, formed the standard for subsequent reprints of the Authorized Version, which differ in a number of details, small in importance but fairly numerous in the aggregate, from the original text of 1611. One other detail remains to be mentioned. In 1666 appeared the first edition of the Authorized Version from which the Apocrypha was omitted. It had previously been omitted from some editions of the Geneva Bible, from 1599 onwards. The Nonconformists took much objection to it, and in 1664 the Long Parliament forbade the reading of lessons from it in public; but the lectionary of the English Church always included lessons from it. The example of omission was followed in many editions subsequently. The first edition printed in America (apart from a surreptitious edition of 1752), in 1782, is without it. In 1826 the British and Foreign Bible Society, which has been one of the principal agents in the circulation of the Scriptures throughout the world, decided never in the future to print or circulate copies containing the Apocrypha; and this decision has been carried into effect ever since.<br><br> \r\n<\/p><p>Frederic G.

F. OSTERVALD<\/strong><br \/>\n<br \/>\nA travers des si&egrave;cles, depuis 1535 (date de la publication de la Bible d&#39;Oliv&eacute;tan), la francophonie poss&eacute;dait une Bible fid&egrave;le. Cette Bible traditionnelle est la repr&eacute;sentation juste de ce que nos fr&egrave;res ont utilis&eacute; &agrave; travers les &acirc;ges. Elle est issue du Texte Re&ccedil;u, qui est la pr&eacute;servation fid&egrave;le des textes originaux et conforme &agrave; l&#39;immense majorit&eacute; des manuscrits qui existent. Il faut rappeler qu&#39;&agrave; sa publication en 1535, la Bible 0liv&eacute;tan a &eacute;t&eacute; la Bible des Vaudois (chr&eacute;tiens &eacute;vang&eacute;liques des Alpes), ainsi que des r&eacute;formateurs Calvin, Farel et Th&eacute;odore de B&egrave;ze. Elle a eu pour fruit des conversions en grand nombre, ainsi qu&#39;un esprit de sacrifice et de r&eacute;veil. En 1560 elle est appel&eacute;e Bible de Gen&egrave;ve. Jusqu&#39;au d&eacute;but du 20&egrave;me si&egrave;cle, elle se perp&eacute;tue par les r&eacute;visions d&#39;Ostervald. Pendant tout ce temps rien n&#39;a &eacute;t&eacute; enlev&eacute; &agrave; la Bible. Il convient donc de pr&eacute;f&eacute;rer la Bible traditionnelle car elle est l&#39;h&eacute;riti&egrave;re des textes utilis&eacute;s par Dieu au fil des si&egrave;cles, ceux qui sont les v&eacute;hicules de sa b&eacute;n&eacute;diction dans les plus grands r&eacute;veils de la foi.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nCet ouvrage est une mise &agrave; jour de l&#39;&eacute;dition de 1886 d&#39;une r&eacute;vision de la Bible d&#39;Ostervald publi&eacute;e pour la premi&egrave;re fois en 1881, dont nous reproduisons ci-dessous la pr&eacute;face:<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<span style=\"color:#330066\"><strong>PR&Eacute;FACE DE LA PREMIERE &Eacute;DITION LA SOCI&Eacute;T&Eacute; BIBLIQUE DE FRANCE<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#330066\"><strong>&quot; Aux Pasteurs, Anciens et Membres des &Eacute;glises protestantes fran&ccedil;aises &quot;.<\/strong><br \/>\nParis, juillet 1881<br \/>\n<br \/>\nNous poss&eacute;dons, dans la traduction de la Bible, revue par J. F. Ostervald, une version dont les origines se confondent avec celles m&ecirc;mes de la R&eacute;formation, et l&#39;histoire avec celles de nos &eacute;glises fran&ccedil;aises. Sa langue a &eacute;t&eacute; jusqu&#39;&agrave; ce jour celle de tous nos sermonnaires, th&eacute;ologiens, controversistes et cat&eacute;chistes. Ses citations remplissent depuis trois si&egrave;cles tous les ouvrages protestants Plusieurs fois revue et corrig&eacute;e, d&#39;Oliv&eacute;tan &agrave; Ostervald, elle s&#39;est acquis sous ce dernier nom une faveur sans &eacute;gale, a pris sa place dans tous nos temples, &agrave; tous nos foyers, dans toutes les m&eacute;moires, et n&#39;a cess&eacute; d&egrave;s lors d&#39;&ecirc;tre &agrave; la fois la plus offerte et la plus demand&eacute;e, m&ecirc;me &agrave; cette heure et depuis la diffusion des traductions nouvelles &agrave; bas prix. C&#39;est en fait, notre v&eacute;ritable et seule version eccl&eacute;siastique et populaire.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nIl nous a sembl&eacute;, apr&egrave;s beaucoup d&#39;autres, qu&#39;il y avait l&agrave;, dans ce pass&eacute; consid&eacute;rable, dans ces longs et pieux services, dans ce ferme attachement des fid&egrave;les, non seulement des titres imposants, mais une puissance dont il serait aussi injuste qu&#39;imprudent de ne pas tenir compte. Il nous a sembl&eacute; qu&#39;une version aussi profond&eacute;ment entr&eacute;e dans nos moeurs et dans notre confiance, pr&eacute;sentait un terrain solide pour des progr&egrave;s imm&eacute;diats et facile-ment acceptables par tous.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nNotre but a donc &eacute;t&eacute; simplement de renouer le fil trop longtemps rompu des R&eacute;visions successives qui ont mis, si&egrave;cle apr&egrave;s si&egrave;cle, cette antique version en &eacute;tat de suffire &agrave; sa t&acirc;che, et faute desquelles elle nous appara&icirc;t maintenant, &ccedil;a et l&agrave;, vieillie, incorrecte et parfois &agrave; peine intelligible. Nous nous sommes propos&eacute;, d&#39;apr&egrave;s la m&eacute;thode qui a toujours pr&eacute;valu chez nos p&egrave;res et que l&#39;Angleterre, I&#39;Am&eacute;rique et l&#39;Allemagne appliquent &eacute;galement &agrave; leurs propres versions, de la maintenir au niveau des progr&egrave;s de la science et des modifications du langage. Heureux si nous pouvons par l&agrave; conserver &agrave; nos &eacute;glises le pr&eacute;cieux avantage d&#39;une version qui, au-dessus ou &agrave; c&ocirc;t&eacute; des pr&eacute;f&eacute;rences individuelles, toujours respectables, soit et demeure la Bible de la grande famille &eacute;vang&eacute;lique fran&ccedil;aise; en qui l&#39;&Eacute;glise se reconnaisse en quelque sorte elle-m&ecirc;me; qu&#39;elle retrouve dans toutes ses chaires; &agrave; laquelle elle renvoie avec s&eacute;curit&eacute; l&#39;incroyant, le pros&eacute;lyte, le faible dans la foi; version mesur&eacute;e et s&ucirc;re; expression, non de la science qui se fait, mais, autant que possible, de la science faite, dans ses r&eacute;sultats av&eacute;r&eacute;s; non des probabilit&eacute;s savantes de demain, mais des certitudes &eacute;prouv&eacute;es d&#39;aujourd&#39;hui; version qui sauvegarde enfin, dans la patrie religieuse, la communaut&eacute; d&#39;une m&ecirc;me langue pour une m&ecirc;me foi.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nC&#39;est dans cette pens&eacute;e que nous nous sommes mis &agrave; l&#39;ouvrage.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nLa R&eacute;vision que nous offrons enfin compl&egrave;te au public, est due &agrave; une double initiative.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nLe Nouveau Testament (1), d&eacute;j&agrave; favorablement connu depuis une dizaine d&#39;ann&eacute;es, est l&#39;&oelig;uvre particuli&egrave;re de M. Ie pasteur Ch. L. Frossard.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nL&#39;Ancien Testament, entrepris sous les auspices de notre Soci&eacute;t&eacute;, est l&#39;&oelig;uvre collective de th&eacute;ologiens et de pasteurs, la plupart d&eacute;sign&eacute;s d&#39;avance, par leur notori&eacute;t&eacute; sp&eacute;ciale, pour une semblable t&acirc;che. Ce sont MM. Ch. Bois, professeur de th&eacute;ologie; P. Bornand, pasteur; Ch. Bruston, professeur de th&eacute;ologie; Ch. Byse, pasteur; P. Chapuis, D. Coussirat, professeurs de th&eacute;ologie; L. Favez, Ch. L. Frossard, feu H. Kruger, Ch. Lauter, E. Le Savoureux, E. Monnier, W. Monod, pasteurs.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nNous livrons aujourd&#39;hui ces travaux &agrave; l&#39;impartiale appr&eacute;ciation de nos fr&egrave;res. Nous attendons de leur part d&#39;utiles observations, et nous saurons en tirer profit.&mdash; ne souhaitant d&#39;ailleurs qu&#39;une chose : c&#39;est que par la faveur de Dieu, cette &oelig;uvre contribue en quelque mesure &agrave; maintenir toujours plus pure et bienfaisante, sur le chandelier de notre &Eacute;glise, la lumi&egrave;re divine qui doit &eacute;clairer la maison tout enti&egrave;re.<\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#330066\">LE COMIT&Eacute;.<\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><br \/>\n<br \/>\nNotre but dans cette &eacute;dition n&#39;est pas diff&eacute;rent de celui des pasteurs et professeurs qui nous ont pr&eacute;c&eacute;d&eacute;s. Leur souci reste le n&ocirc;tre : qu&#39;une Bible fid&egrave;le soit dans les mains de nos fid&egrave;les pour apprendre de Celui qui est toujours fid&egrave;le.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nEn ce qui concerne les modifications apport&eacute;es, nous avons &eacute;limin&eacute; les chiffres romains et chang&eacute; la formule du texte &agrave; celle du d&eacute;coupage en versets. Les notes et renvois de la Bible de 1886 sont rassembl&eacute;s &agrave; la fin dans une liste selon la r&eacute;f&eacute;rence biblique, les renvois &eacute;tant not&eacute;s par un ast&eacute;risque dans le texte. Quelques transformations orthographiques ou grammaticales ont &eacute;t&eacute; effectu&eacute;es, et quelques mots d&eacute;suets ont &eacute;t&eacute; am&eacute;lior&eacute;s pour une meilleure compr&eacute;hension. Ces modifications ne sont pas not&eacute;es par des renvois. D&#39;autre part, quelques alt&eacute;rations ont &eacute;t&eacute; port&eacute;es au texte de 1886 pour raison de fid&eacute;lit&eacute; au Texte Re&ccedil;u. Ces modifications sont not&eacute;es par des renvois o&ugrave; figurent les mots exacts de la r&eacute;vision de 1886. Une autre transformation est &agrave; noter : le mot antichrist remplace antechrist de la r&eacute;vision de 1886. Antichrist est la traduction fid&egrave;le du mot grec antichristos, qui signifie contre le ou l&#39;opposant du Christ.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nNous ne pouvons que r&eacute;p&eacute;ter ce que nos pr&eacute;d&eacute;cesseurs ont souhait&eacute; il y a maintenant plus d&#39;un si&egrave;cle. Nous aussi, nous voulons que par la faveur de Dieu, cette &oelig;uvre contribue en quelque mesure &agrave; maintenir toujours plus pure et bienfaisante, sur le chandelier de nos &Eacute;glises, &quot;la lumi&egrave;re divine qui doit &eacute;clairer la maison tout enti&egrave;re.&quot;<br \/>\n<br \/>\nAMEN !<br \/>\n<br \/>\n(1) D&#39;apr&egrave;s l&#39;&eacute;dition gr. in-8&deg;, 1880, c&#39;est-&agrave;-dire avec les derni&egrave;res corrections de l&#39;auteur.<\/p>\n\n<p>Downloaded from <a href=\"http:\/\/ichthus.pompignane.free.fr\/NewFiles\/biboster.html\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/ichthus.pompignane.free.fr\/NewFiles\/biboster.html<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;\n<p><br \/>\nThis Bible imported from The Unbound Bible <a href=\"http:\/\/unbound.biola.edu\/\">http:\/\/unbound.biola.edu\/<\/a><\/p>\n<\/p>\n","lang":"French","lang_short":"fr","copyright":0,"italics":0,"strongs":0,"red_letter":0,"paragraph":0,"rank":160,"research":0,"restrict":0,"copyright_id":1,"copyright_statement":"This Bible is in the Public Domain.","rtl":0,"lang_native":"Fran\u00e7ais","downloadable":true},"afri":{"name":"Afrikaans 1953","shortname":"Afrikaans","module":"afri","year":"1953","owner":null,"description":"<html><head><meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text\/html; charset=UTF-8\"><\/head><body><b>Afrikaans 1953<\/b><p \/>1933\/1953 Afrikaans Bybel,<br \/>\nCopyright 1933, 1953, Bybelgenootskap van Suid Afrika<p \/>\nThis copyright Bible has kindly been made available by the Bible Society of South Africa, strictly for non-commercial use with The SWORD Project.

This version contains all 6 of the textual elements of the OTA document: consonants, vowels, cantillation marks, \"paragraph\" (pe, samekh) markers, and ketib-qere variants. Morphological divisions may be added later.\n<p \/>\nThe BHS so-called \"paragraph\" markers (pe and samekh) do not actually occur in the Leningrad Codex. The editors of BHS use them to indicate open space deliberately left blank by the scribe. Pe (\"open\" paragraph) represents a space between verses, where the new verse begins on a new column line. This represents a major section of the text. Samekh (\"closed\" paragraph) represents a space of less than a line between verses. This is understood to be a subdivision of the corresponding \"open\" section. Since these markers represent an actual physical feature of the text, they have been retained. \n<p \/>\nThe transcription was based on the \"Supplement to the code manual for the Michigan Old Testament\" by Alan Groves. \n<p \/>\nThe WLC is maintained by the Westminster Hebrew Institute, Philadelphia, PA (<a href='http:\/\/whi.wts.edu\/WHI' target='_blank'>http:\/\/whi.wts.edu\/WHI<\/a>) \n<p \/>\nSword module maintained by Martin Gruner (mg dot pub at gmx dot net).<\/body><\/html>\r\n<br \/><br \/>This Bible imported from The Unbound Bible <a href='http:\/\/unbound.biola.edu\/'>http:\/\/unbound.biola.edu\/<\/a>","lang":"Hebrew","lang_short":"he","copyright":0,"italics":0,"strongs":0,"red_letter":0,"paragraph":0,"rank":300,"research":0,"restrict":0,"copyright_id":1,"copyright_statement":"This Bible is in the Public Domain.","rtl":1,"lang_native":"\u05e2\u05d1\u05e8\u05d9\u05ea","downloadable":true},"kn_irv":{"name":"\u0c87\u0c82\u0ca1\u0cbf\u0caf\u0ca8\u0ccd \u0cb0\u0cbf\u0cb5\u0cc8\u0c9c\u0ccd\u0ca1\u0ccd \u0cb5\u0cb0\u0ccd\u0cb8\u0ca8\u0ccd (IRV) - \u0c95\u0ca8\u0ccd\u0ca8\u0ca1","shortname":"\u0c95\u0ca8\u0ccd\u0ca8\u0ca1 IRV","module":"kn_irv","year":"2017, 2019","owner":"Bridge Connectivity Solutions","description":"<h2>\u0c87\u0c82\u0ca1\u0cbf\u0caf\u0ca8\u0ccd \u0cb0\u0cbf\u0cb5\u0cc8\u0c9c\u0ccd\u0ca1\u0ccd \u0cb5\u0cb0\u0ccd\u0cb8\u0ca8\u0ccd (IRV) - \u0c95\u0ca8\u0ccd\u0ca8\u0ca1 - 2019<\/h2><h2>The Indian Revised Version Holy Bible in the Kannada language of India<\/h2><p>copyright \u00a9 2017, 2019 <a href=\"https:\/\/bridgeconn.com\/\">Bridge Connectivity Solutions<\/a><br>Language: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ethnologue.org\/language\/kan\">\u0c95\u0ca8\u0ccd\u0ca8\u0ca1 (Kannada)<\/a><br>Translation by: Bridge Connectivity Solutions<br>Contributor: Bridge Connectivity Solutions Pvt.

It was not until the progress of criticism had revealed the defective state of the received Greek text of the New Testament that any movement arose for the revision of the Authorized Version. About the year 1855 the question began to be mooted in magazine articles and motions in Convocation, and by way of bringing it to a head a small group of scholars (Dr. Ellicott, afterwards bishop of Gloucester, Dr. Moberly, head master of Winchester and afterwards bishop of Salisbury, Dr. Barron, principal of St. Edmund's Hall, Oxford, the Rev. H. Alford, afterwards dean of Canterbury, and the Rev. W.G. Humphrey; with the Rev. E. Hawkins, secretary of the S.P.G., and afterwards canon of Westminster, as their secretary) undertook a revision of the Authorized Version of John, which was published in 1857. Six of the Epistles followed in 1861 and 1863, by which time the object of the work, in calling attention to the need and the possibility of a revision, had been accomplished. Meanwhile a great stimulus to the interest in textual criticism had been given by the discovery of the Codex Sinaiticus, and by the work of Tischendorf and Tregelles. In February 1870 a motion for a committee to consider the desirableness of a revision was adopted by both houses of the Convocation of Canterbury; and definite motions in favor of such a revision were passed in the following May. The Convocation of York did not concur, and thenceforth the Southern Houses proceeded alone. A committee of both houses drew up the lists of revisers, and framed the rules for their guidance. The Old Testament company consisted of 25 (afterwards 27) members, the New Testament of 26. The rules prescribed the introduction of as few alterations in the Authorized Version as possible consistently with faithfulness; the text to be adopted for which the evidence is decidedly preponderating, and when it differs from that from which the Authorized Version was made, the alteration to be indicated in the margin (this rule was found impracticable); alterations to be made on the first revision by simple majorities, but to be retained only if passed by a two-thirds majority on the second revision. Both companies commenced work at Westminster on June 22, 1870. The New Testament company met on 407 days in the course of eleven years, the Old Testament company on 792 days in fifteen years. Early in the work the cooperation of American scholars was invited, and in consequence two companies of 15 and 16 members respectively were formed, which began work in 1872, considering the results of the English revision as each section of it was forwarded to them. The collaboration of the English and American companies was perfectly harmonious; and by agreement those recommendations of the American Revisers which were not adopted by the English companies, but to which the proposers nevertheless wished to adhere, were printed in an appendix to the published Bible. Publication took place, in the case of the New Testament, on May 17, 1881, and in the case of the canonical books of the Old Testament almost exactly four years later. The revision of the Apocrypha was divided between the two English companies, and was taken up by each company on the completion of its main work. The New Testament company distributed Sirach, Tobit, Judith, Wisdom, 1 and 2 Maccabees among three groups of its members, and the Old Testament company appointed a small committee to deal with the remaining books. The work dragged on over many years, involving some inequalities in revision, and ultimately the Apocrypha was published in 1895.<br><br> \nIn dealing with the Old Testament the Revisers were not greatly concerned with questions of text. The Massoretic Hebrew text available in 1870 was substantially the same as that which King James' translators had before them; and the criticism of the Septuagint version was not sufficiently advanced to enable them safely to make much use of it except in marginal notes. Their work consisted mainly in the correction of mistranslations which imperfect Hebrew scholarship had left in the Authorized Version. Their changes as a rule are slight, but tend very markedly to remove obscurities and to improve the intelligibility of the translation. The gain is greatest in the poetical and prophetical books (poetical passages are throughout printed as such, which in itself is a great improvement), and there cannot be much doubt that if the revision of the Old Testament had stood by itself it would have been generally accepted without much opposition. With the new version of the New Testament the case was different. The changes were necessarily more numerous than in the Old Testament, and the greater familiarity with the New Testament possessed by readers in general made the alterations more conspicuous. The New Testament revisers had, in effect, to form a new Greek text before they could proceed to translate it. In this part of their work they were largely influenced by the presence of Drs. Westcott and Hort, who, as will be shown elsewhere [TEXT OF THE NEW TESTAMENT], were keen and convinced champions of the class of text of which the best representative is the Codex Vaticanus. At the same time Dr. Scrivener, who took a less advanced view of the necessity of changes in the Received Text, was also a prominent member of the company, and it is probably true that not many new readings were adopted which had not the support of Tischendorf and Tregelles, and which would not be regarded by nearly all scholars acquainted with textual criticism as preferable to those of the Authorized Version. To Westcott and Hort may be assigned a large part of the credit for leading the Revisers definitely along the path of critical science; but the Revisers did not follow their leaders the whole way, and their text (edited by Archdeacon Palmer for the Oxford Press in 1881) represents a more conservative attitude than that of the two Cambridge scholars. Nevertheless the amount of textual change was considerable, and to this was added a very large amount of verbal change, sometimes (especially in the Epistles) to secure greater intelligibility, but oftener (and this is more noticeable in the Gospels) to secure uniformity in the translation of Greek words which the Authorized Version deliberately rendered differently in different places (even in parallel narratives of the same event), and precision in the representation of moods and tenses. It was to the great number of changes of this kind, which by themselves appeared needless and pedantic, that most of the criticism bestowed upon the Revised Version was due; but it must be remembered that where the words and phrases of a book are often strained to the uttermost in popular application, it is of great importance that those words and phrases should be as accurately rendered as possible. On the whole, it is certain that the Revised Version marks a great advance on the Authorized Version in respect of accuracy, and the main criticisms to which it is justly open are that the principles of classical Greek were applied too rigidly to Greek which is not classical, and that the Revisers, in their careful attention to the Greek, were less happily inspired than their predecessors with the genius of the English language. These defects have no doubt militated against the general acceptance of the Revised Version; but whether they continue to do so or not (and it is to be remembered that we have not yet passed through nearly so long a period as that during which the Authorized Version competed with the Geneva Bible or Jerome's Vulgate with the Old Latin), it is certain that no student of the Bible can afford to neglect the assistance given by the Revised Version towards the true understanding of the Scriptures. In so using it, it should be remembered that renderings which appear in the margin not infrequently represent the views of more than half the Revisers, though they failed to obtain the necessary two-thirds majority. This is perhaps especially the case in the Old Testament, where the Revised Version shows a greater adherence to the Authorized Version than in the New Testament.<br><br> \nIt only remains to add that, after the lapse of the 14 years during which it was agreed that no separate American edition should be brought out, while the American appendix continued to appear in the English Revised Version, the American Revisers issued a fresh recension (New Testament in 1900, Old Testament in 1901, without the Apocrypha), embodying not only the readings which appeared in their appendix to the English Revised Version, but also others on which they had since agreed. It is unfortunate that the action originally taken by the English revisers with a view to securing that the two English-speaking nations should continue to have a common Bible should have brought about the opposite result; and though the alterations introduced by the American revisers eminently deserve consideration on their merits, it may be doubted whether the net result is important enough to justify the existence of a separate version. What influence it may have upon the history of the English Bible in the future it is for the future to decide.<br><br> \nFrederic G.

It was not until the progress of criticism had revealed the defective state of the received Greek text of the New Testament that any movement arose for the revision of the Authorized Version. About the year 1855 the question began to be mooted in magazine articles and motions in Convocation, and by way of bringing it to a head a small group of scholars (Dr. Ellicott, afterwards bishop of Gloucester, Dr. Moberly, head master of Winchester and afterwards bishop of Salisbury, Dr. Barron, principal of St. Edmund&#39;s Hall, Oxford, the Rev. H. Alford, afterwards dean of Canterbury, and the Rev. W.G. Humphrey; with the Rev. E.

Datorit\u0103 faptului c\u0103 exist\u0103 a\u015fa de multe traduceri ast\u0103zi care provin din surse diverse, am avut nevoie de o traducere modern\u0103 bazat\u0103 numai pe textul ebraic Masoretic \u015fi textul grecesc Textus Receptus pentru a verifica acurate\u0163ea traducerii noastre.
